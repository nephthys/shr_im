NAME
	Django Twitter Auth -- use Twitter for authentication in Django

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
	Twitter now supports OAuth, so django-twitterauth has been rewritten
	to support this better authentication flow.  It is well documented
	elsewhere so I will not be going into detail here.

	The app supplies views to handle the login flow, a user info page
	and a *basic* User model.

	Mad props to Henrik Lied for the initial Django implementation of
	Twitter OAuth.  I used his utils.py file almost verbatim in creating
	this app.

INSTALLATION
	Clone/download and place in the root of your Django project:

		$ cd $YOUR_DJANGO_PROJECT
		$ git clone git://github.com/rcrowley/django-twitterauth.git auth
		$ echo auth >> .gitignore

	You'll need to add this app to your settings.py file in the
	INSTALLED_APPS section.  You'll also need these two extra lines:

		TWITTERAUTH_KEY = 'OH HAI'
		TWITTERAUTH_SECRET = 'OH NOES'

	Setup the URLs for the auth app.  The names of the URLs are required.
	For example:

		url(r'^info/?$', 'auth.views.info', name='auth_info'),
		url(r'^login/?$', 'auth.views.login', name='auth_login'),
		url(r'^login/callback/?$', 'auth.views.callback', name='auth_callback'),
		url(r'^logout/?$', 'auth.views.logout', name='auth_logout'),

	Again, the names of the URLs are required.  I chose not to create
	auth/urls.py because URLs like /auth/login et cetera seems awful.

	Make sure to run `python manage.py syncdb` to create the User model.
